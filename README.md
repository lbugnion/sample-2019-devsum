## Taking Advantage of AI easily with Azure Cognitive Services

**Abstract:** Data Science and Artificial Intelligence are fascinating areas of computing. Microsoft is betting a lot on these new technologies, but we are also aware that data scientists are highly trained professionals, and that not every software developer can create and maintain complex data models, perform linear algebra or purchase expensive GPU rigs to run these models. This is exactly why we created Cognitive services. This suite of services offers pre-trained models that you can use out-of-the-box to perform operations in Vision, Speech, Knowledge, Search and Language. In this session, Laurent Bugnion, a Cloud Developer Advocate with Microsoft will show you how you can use cognitive services to enhance your applications with advanced capabilities, how you can refine the trained models with your own data and how you can integrate Cognitive Services with other Azure services to automate tasks.
